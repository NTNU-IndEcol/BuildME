# BuildME

Framework to calculate building material & energy expenditures.

The framework was originally created by Niko Heeren for the work on the [UNEP IRP report on Ressource Efficiency](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3542680) and further developed by other contributors: Kamila Krych, Sahin Akin, and others.

## Publications

The code was used in the following publications:
