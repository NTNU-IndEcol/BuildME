We choose mixed humid climate such as in Baltimore (climate region **4A**) in the reference year **2015**. We are interested in how the energy standard influences the energy use in the building, so we select four different ones: **standard**, **non-standard** (below standard), **efficient** and **ZEB**.\n",

The names of the weather file for each climate are specified in the `climate_stations` variable in `settings.py`.
