# Setup BuildME

## Initial setup

- Download and copy the [desired energyplus binaries](https://energyplus.net/downloads) into e.g. `./bin/EnergyPlus-9-2-0`. See also the [Energyplus](#Energyplus) section below for more info.
- Correct the paths in `BuildME/settings.py`

The current version should work on macOS and Windows. Linux support could easily be added by editing `ep_exec_files` in `settings.py`.

### MacOS 

macOS does not allow to run unnotarized apps. Therefore, it is necessary to allow energyplus to run. I am trying to find the best way to fix this at the moment.
The script will run `fix_macos_quarantine()` to give necessary permissions, but this may not be enugh. If you have issues, try the following:
- Open `System Preferences > Security & Privacy` If you see the button `Allow anyway`, click it. This step has to be repeated for each library and executable :(
- Open `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy`, scroll to `Developper Tools` and add `Terminal.app` 
- Run `sudo xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine ./bin/EnergyPlus-9-6-0` on your energyplus folder.

## Environment

We recommend using a dedicated [Python environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments) using Miniconda. Learn more on how to install [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

## Instaling dependencies

[//]: # "TODO"

BuildME relies on the great [eppy](https://github.com/santoshphilip/eppy) package. However, it is not listed as a Anaconda package. Therefore installation requires the use of `pip`. In case you use miniconda, follow [this procedure](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43729857/2075003):
```bash
conda install pip 
which pip  # make sure the path corresponds to your conda environment
pip install eppy
```

Other dpendencies include:
- pandas
- openpyxl
- tqdm

## Energyplus

Please not that the archetype files in  the [archetypes folder](archetypes) are specific to the energyplus version. If your binaries in `./bin/` do not correspond to the ones in the `.idf` files (see `Version` keyword), you are likely to run into issues.
